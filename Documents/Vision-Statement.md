# Project Description
We are building a game with a focus on an interesting battle system. Players
will draw symbols on their screen to perfom actions such as attacks and
defenses against an AI system. Players will be challenged to make decisions
in real time with a trade off of more powerful actions having more complexity
to draw. Players will strategize their actions based off incoming attacks,
curent defenses, health status, and ability. Players will be rewarded with
scores that reflect their competence in battle as well as new actions and/or powerups

# Who Our Users Are
Our Users are people who enjoy leveling up their characters and planning
strategic moves in real time. Our users also enjoy seeing their names on leaderboards
for high scores and are completionists, wanting to unlock all the different
possible actions available.

# Project Value


# Project Success Criteria
Our team will consider this project a success if we recieve a "C" or better.
