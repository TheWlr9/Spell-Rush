# "Spell Rush"  Vision Statement

### Project Description

We are building a game with a focus on an innovative battle system. Players
will draw symbols on their screen to perfom actions such as attacks and
defenses to battle simple AI enemies. Players will be need to make quick decisions
in real time, with more powerful actions requiring more drawing complexity. Throughout the game, players will strategize their actions based on incoming attacks, their curent defenses, health, and learned attack gestures. Players will be rewarded with scores that reflect their competence in battle as well as new actions and/or powerups. These scores can be submitted to a local leaderboard. 

### Who Our Users Are

Our game appeals to casual Android users with as little as 5 minutes to spare for a fast-paced real time strategy boss rush game. Due to the simple combat system, users anywhere from 7 - 90 years of age will enjoy our game.  The leaderboard will challenge the more hardcore gaming audience and completionists to achieve their highest score, while uncovering new abilities and gestures.

### Project Value

Our app provides entertainment. Users will exercise their problem solving skills as they work toward mastery of our battle system. As the difficulty increases, players will be pushed to become evermore proficient. Users will be encouraged to share their experiences and scores with friends. The app will spark friendly competition among players through the leaderboard and acceptable amounts of "trash-talking".
