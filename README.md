# "Spell Rush"  Vision Statement

### Project Description

We are building a game with a focus on an interesting battle system. Players
will draw symbols on their screen to perfom actions such as attacks and
defenses against an AI system. Players will be challenged to make decisions
in real time with a trade off of more powerful actions having more complexity
to draw. Players will strategize their actions based off incoming attacks,
curent defenses, health status, and ability. Players will be rewarded with
scores that reflect their competence in battle as well as new actions and/or powerups

### Who Our Users Are

Our Users are people who enjoy leveling up characters and planning
strategic moves in real time. Our users also enjoy seeing their names on leaderboards
for high scores and are completionists, wanting to unlock all the different
possible actions available.

### Project Value

Our project provides entertainment, with little to no investment for the end user.
Users will develop and improve upon problem solving and Motor skills as they work toward
mastery of the battle system. Users will be pushed to become ever more proficient
with these skills as difficulty increases. Users will be encouraged to invest socially
in friendships with healthy competition through the leaderboard and acceptable amounts
of "trash-talking".

### Project Success Criteria

Our team will consider this project a success if we recieve a "C" or better.
